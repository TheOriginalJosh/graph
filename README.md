# NativeScript drag-n-drop experiment

### Horizontal scrolling the background with pan event
### Horizontal scrolling the left line with pan event
### Vertical scrolling the top line with pan event

Works fine in iOS, but not in Android
- sometimes the lines do scroll
- the background doesn't scroll
